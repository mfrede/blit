Baseline Information Tracking

This batch file (yeah, I said batch file) MUST be (ok, doesn't have to be but some of the information won't be captured) run as an administrator.

Simple enough.


To Use:
Open command prompt as administrator
Run prorgam

Will create text file with all the information.

I use this for forensics investigations and as part of my information security risk assessments.

Enjoy!
